A personal portfolio website for the projects and photography. You can check it out [here.](https://theseed.website)

The front end was created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The images are hosted on [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), and the site itself is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This was the long way of saying it's a GCN stack website.
